# Airline Customer Satisfaction Analytics
📌 Project Overview ( PROJECT 1 (JUPYTERNOTEBOOK & ML Project)
This project builds an end-to-end data science workflow to analyze and predict airline passenger satisfaction using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
The goal is to:
1. Explore what factors drive customer satisfaction 
2. Clean and prepare real-world data
3. Build machine learning models to predict satisfaction
4. Interpret results and provide business insights
   
📌 This project demonstrates skills in:
1. Python & NumPy
2. Pandas & Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
6. Model Evaluation & Interpretation
Jupyter Notebook

🧾 Dataset Description 

The dataset contains airline passenger information, including:

1. Passenger details: Gender, Age, Customer Type
2. Flight details: Class, Distance, Departure Delay, Arrival Delay, Travel Type
3. Service ratings: Seat Comfort, Cleanliness, Food, WiFi, Entertainment, etc.
4. Target variable: Satisfaction
-- satisfied
-- neutral or dissatisfied
5. Each row represents one passenger’s flight experience.
